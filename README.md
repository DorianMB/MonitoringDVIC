## More informations

this is a student project for DVIC (De Vinci Innovation Center). With this monitoring app you can create and manage customers and missions. Statistics will be coming later.

I'm a FrontEnd developper so it's just a FrontEnd app. Database is emulated with localStorage. I didn't want to waste time setting up a back end knowing that I don't want to do back end development for DVIC projects.
